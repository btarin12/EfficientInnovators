Optimizing Kidney Paired Donation (KPD) enables an incompatible donor-recipient pair to get matched with another pair to increase the availability of another kidney. This project highlights an Operations Research approach for maximizing the number of compatible kidney transplants in the United States. Using Gurobi and cross-checking for accuracy using Python, we formulated and solved integer programming models to find optimal 2- and 3-way exchange cycles that respect compatibility and cycle size constraints. The open operational methodology with detailed input data, code, and results descriptions can enable reproducibility and future research. We present a systematic review of the proposed KPD plans based on optimization techniques, which improves the efficiency of the overall live kidney transplantation process, and results in novel contributions. 

Using the code in the Jupyter Notebook (Efficient_Innovators_Project.ipynb) with data set (Efficient_Innovators.json), 366 total pairs were identified.
